**Welcome to Luminous XOX**, a vibrant, neon-inspired twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game! This project focuses not only on fun but also on delivering an engaging, visually captivating user experience. It combines dynamic neon lights and smooth animations, making every interaction feel like a new level of excitement.

It's an interactive neon experience that mixes gaming with aesthetics. The combination of dynamic visuals, responsive design, and smooth UX animations creates a product that’s as fun to play as it is to look at.


### UI/UX Design:
Clean and Minimalistic Layout: The interface follows a minimalist design principle, allowing players to focus entirely on the game without distractions. The game grid is clear and simple, with ample space between elements to avoid a cluttered feel. The font is modern, bold, and easy to read, with a high contrast between text and background to ensure clarity.

### User-Friendly Experience: 
The controls are intuitive and easy to understand. With just a click, players can start a new game, and the layout naturally guides them through the game. The use of neon colors not only enhances the visual appeal but also helps in drawing attention to important game elements such as the grid, moves, and buttons.

### Engagement with Feedback:
The design gives immediate visual feedback for each action. When a player places an X or O, it lights up in a glowing effect, giving a sense of accomplishment for every move. Whether the player wins, loses, or ties, they receive clear visual cues with the neon glow signaling the end of the game.

### Bright and Playful Theme: 
The choice of neon colors adds a playful and high-energy vibe to the game. This makes it more than just a game – it becomes an experience. The bright lights paired with a dark background not only enhance visual appeal but also ensure that the content is easy to see, even in low-light settings.
